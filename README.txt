To play chess, simply run mainSpeecy.py from the command line.

To play a piece, you will need to use this dictionary to choose your tiles:

A = Alpha
B = Bravo
C = Charlie
D = Delta
E = Echo
F = Foxtrot
G = Golf
H = Hotel

And the numerical values on the vertical side are the same.

For example, use "Golf Two Golf Four" to move the second white pawn two tiles down the board.

Also you need to press the play button each time you want to command your moves.
